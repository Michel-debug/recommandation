## Execute instruction
- cd current directory.  
- ***Infer Mode*** Execute `./start.sh data/train_ratings.csv [similarity threshold]`  the parameter **similarity threshold** by defaut is 0.05, you can modify it. for exemple: `./start.sh data/train_ratings.csv 0.055`  
*attention:cause i used the cosine similarity, and i advise you to set up similarity threshold 0.01 - 0.08, please do not use too large threshold*  

- ***Evaluate Mode*** If you want to proceed evaluate our model, you can input the command `python3 evaluate.py`, it could be evaluated correctly  

- And wait some times to print out result, to reduce time, i've saved the cached time, Normally, it would read the cache file directly, if you don't want use directley the cache file, you can remove the name 'out.cache' file.‚≠êÔ∏è But i don't advise you to do that, it could spent lots of time to execute, maybe 10min-30min ‚≠êÔ∏è  

- the refer's speed depends on your cpu cores, if your computer have more cpucores, il will run fast.
